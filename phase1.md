### Goal:

The primary objective of this project is to emphasize the significance of body performance in enhancing physical health and promoting exercise awareness among individuals. This will be accomplished by analyzing and extracting valuable insights from body performance datasets, monitoring the progression of human age, and subsequently improving the overall awareness of its importance.

### Data Source:

It from Kaggle website , The link( <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/body-performance-data>) show the source data.

### General Information about Body performance dataset :

Our dataset is called "Body performance" , The dataset provide the grade of performance and some data such as gender and age along with body measurements and other performance tests , It has 13394 row and each of them have 11 attributes.
