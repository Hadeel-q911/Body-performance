# Introduction 

Body measurements refer to the numerical values that represent various aspects of a person's body size and proportions. We have chosen to utilize a body performance database for our project due to several motivations. Firstly, by having a grade of performance with age, we can accurately track and analyze the changes and improvements in body performance over time. In today's digital age, people are increasingly attached to their phones, leading to sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, and decreased physical activity. having access to a comprehensive database will provide us with a wealth of information and data about the various aspects of human body performance. This data can greatly enhance our understanding of the factors that contribute to optimal performance.
